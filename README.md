# deepQL-ctrl
Human-level control using Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep Q learning) in OpenAI's gym cartpole environment with pytorch

- A simple implementation of the paper **"Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"** from **DeepMind** in python, using Pytorch framework.
- to train the agent and the deep Q network run `train.py`.
- the parameters of the Q neural network and the agent could be set directly in `train.py`.
- models and result plots are saved in the corresponding directories.
